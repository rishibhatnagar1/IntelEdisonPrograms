So I have heard alot about MQTT and CoAp in the past couple of days, so I thought I would give it a shot and write a simple application using the same.

So to start with, MQTT can be installed by the instructions given here: http://mosquitto.org/download/

This is where you should start, it has everything you need to know to start using it:
https://2lemetry.atlassian.net/wiki/display/KB/Connecting+to+ThingFabric+in+Python

Those who plan to use 2lemetry and follow the proces for the same, please make a note of the fact that the publish /subcribe topics given on the tools sections are the ones you have to use too. You will not have permissions to use the other topics yet, there is a process involved to make it work which I am yet to figure out.

So I had successfully made the things work using intel edison and the 2lemetry broker, wanted to find out how to use the data and send it to a server , so I will be experimenting with Heroku right now, loves these guys! : https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cloudmqtt#using-with-python

######################## With Pubnub #################
So the basic example that has been provided by PubNub was just tested. Here the publish/subscribe keys have been generated using Mosquitto (I think)

2lemetry did not have the example of subscribing which was provided by Pubnub and made my life easy.


Warning:
You need a local broker moquitto in my case to test things , generate your own keys, username etc. If you are just planning to use mqtt for testing purpose ,you can use the one provided by PUBNUB. Since I did not want to expose data, I am trying to install mosquitto on my MAC device.
MAC OS X for some reason was not able to run the moquitto broker, it works fine on windows for now. You need to run the broker locally so that most of work can be done and tested at all times without exposing your data to an external entity.

If your network does not allow HTTPS connections for some reason specially at workplaces, I would request you to connected your edison to some other network to test the publish and subscribe functions.

##Update ##
Going to try installing the broker on edison and test if I can run it all locally will keep you updated on that.
