The codes have been tried, success rate is not high.

Update: There are definitely power issue with the board, according to some blogs, it might not be able to give out as much current as is required by the sensor.

If you are going to use the Intel's version of the Arduino, the code works, with a low success rate, it has very very low success rate with Python codes written directly though.

All the codes have been tried on Yocto linux. I will update more details about how to make it all work on Ubilinux, but no plans for now to work with these boards. Moving to Beagle Bone soon.
