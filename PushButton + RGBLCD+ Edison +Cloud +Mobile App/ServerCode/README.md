#Server code

I have written the code using the exprestify module written by Ajith N N (github.com/ajithnn). 
To install the module, you will have to do the following:

npm install exprestify --save

This should install the latest version of the module, version as of now is 0.2.0, if its not that, use

npm install exprestify@0.2.0 --save

All the code has been commented. For more information on how to use the module, check out : https://github.com/ajithnn/exprestify/tree/master/Examples

Update: Cross origin resource sharing headers have been added, all the code has been tested after deploying it on heroku.
