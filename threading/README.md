#Why should we use threading

Often times, while working with various sensor points, where we need the data to be fetched concurrently, the sequential programs will fail miserably.
Not only this, since a typical python code I write would be sequential in nature, it will act as a blocking code.
To make sure I use the processor more efficiently, I will try to move to threads.

This is where I will keep all my test codes.
